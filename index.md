# A true Guardian of the Galaxy: Groot

The last surviving member of the tree-like alien race "Flora colossus", Groot is perhaps one of the most unusual beings in all the cosmos. Though calm and quiet in most instances, he is known to unleash his tremendous strength on any enemy foolish enough to threaten his allies, particularly his long- time partner in crime, Rocket Raccoon.

## Groot's Powers and Abilities:

	* Superhuman strength
	* Ability to quickly regenerate after enduring physical damage
	* Plantlike form enables him to grow or reshape his limbs and root himself in place for enhanced stability
	* Can emit glowing spores.
